# credit-risk-classification
By: Itzel Vázquez Sánchez

## Project Description 

This project is part of the Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp from Tecnológico de Monterrey. In this assignment, the task was to use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk, using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

This Project is the result of the learning lessons of Module 20: Supervised Learning from the Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp 2025. The main goal is to use the acquired habilities and knowledge in a real case.
